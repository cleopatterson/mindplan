FACT FIND — INITIAL MEETING NOTES
Client: Simon Blake
Date: 2 February 2025
Adviser: Jenny Wu

Simon Blake, aged around 44. Works in IT — not sure of exact role or employer.
Says he earns "about $130k".

Super is with some industry fund — couldn't remember which one. Thinks the balance is around $80,000. Has been contracting for the last few years so contributions have been irregular.

Owns a 2-bedroom unit in Newtown, bought a few years ago. Thinks it's worth about $750,000 now. Has a mortgage with Westpac, outstanding amount approximately $480,000. Not sure of the interest rate — "whatever the standard variable is".

Has a car — some kind of sedan, maybe 2017 model. Didn't give a value.

Bank account with Westpac, says there's "not much in there, maybe $10,000 or so".

No investment properties, no shares, no other investments.

Single, never married. No children. Parents are both alive and well.

Insurance: Has whatever the default cover is through his super fund. No private insurance.

Estate planning: No will. No power of attorney. Nothing in place.

Objectives (vague):
- "Sort out my finances"
- "Maybe look at getting an investment property eventually"
- Wants to make sure he's "not going to be broke when I'm old"
