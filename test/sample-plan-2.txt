4. Consider strategies to maximise Lisa's super before she retires
5. Review the dormant Andreou Imports company — wind up or retain?
6. Minimise CGT on the Bondi investment property if they decide to sell
7. Estate planning: ensure wealth transfers smoothly to George, Elena, and Sophie
8. Holiday home — keep or sell? Currently underutilised (used ~6 weeks per year)
